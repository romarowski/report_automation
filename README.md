# Automated reports with LaTeX and Python

I created an tool that automates Enviromental Performance reports. The tool uses pandas to calculate metrics and 
automatically adds informative comments using statistical metrics to the different figures presented in the plot, e.g.:
> The highest measurement of the studied period was registered on Thursday, 16 December at the station station_name. 
> Furthermore, the Pearson coefficient of correlation for these two variables during the day of maximum ocurrance is -0.27 indicating small correlation.

The report looks to bring correlations between air traffic and local air quality:
